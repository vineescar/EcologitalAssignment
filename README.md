# Assignment README

## Overview
This is a 3-day assignment completed for ecologital. Due to time constraints, the assignment was built using TypeScript and a simple local file-based database (`data.json`) instead of a connection to MongoDB. Although MongoDB integration was planned, it was not implemented due to time limitations.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   node server.js
   npm start

### Key Points Covered:
1. **Installation and Running**: Instructions for `npm install`, running the server (`server.js`), and starting the frontend (`npm start`).
2. **Limitations**: Acknowledgment that MongoDB wasn't connected and Redux wasn't used due to the nature of the application.
3. **Backend Services**: Explanation of the decision to keep everything in one file (`server.js`).
4. **Data Handling**: The use of `data.json` as the database instead of MongoDB.
5. **Working Video**: A placeholder for the video demonstration link.
