# Assignment README

## Overview
This is a 3-day assignment completed for Ecologital. Due to time constraints, the assignment was built using TypeScript and a simple local file-based database (`data.json`) instead of a connection to MongoDB. Although MongoDB integration was planned, it was not implemented due to time limitations.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version >=14.x)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Libraries and Dependencies Used
The following libraries and dependencies were used in this project:

### Frontend
- **React** (`^18.3.1`)  
  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- **React Router DOM** (`^6.28.0`)  
  A library for adding routing capabilities to React applications.

- **Material-UI** (`^6.1.6`)  
  A popular React UI framework for building modern, responsive designs.
  
- **@mui/icons-material** (`^6.1.6`)  
  Material UI icons for React.
  
- **Axios** (`^1.7.7`)  
  A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.

- **@emotion/react** (`^11.13.3`)  
  A library for writing CSS styles with JavaScript.

- **@emotion/styled** (`^11.13.0`)  
  A CSS-in-JS library used with React to style components.

### Development
- **TypeScript** (`^4.9.5`)  
  A superset of JavaScript that provides static typing.

- **Jest** (`^27.5.1`)  
  A JavaScript testing framework for running tests on the application.

- **@testing-library/react** (`^16.0.1`)  
  A testing utility for React that helps in testing components.

- **@testing-library/jest-dom** (`^6.6.3`)  
  Custom matchers for Jest that help in testing the DOM.

- **React Scripts** (`5.0.1`)  
  A set of scripts for creating React apps using Create React App.

### Backend (for local development)
- **Express** (`^4.21.1`)  
  A web framework for Node.js used to build the server.

- **CORS** (`^2.8.5`)  
  A package to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the server.

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   
### Key Points Covered:
1. **Installation and Running**: Instructions for `npm install`, running the server (`server.js`), and starting the frontend (`npm start`).
2. **Limitations**: Acknowledgment that MongoDB wasn't connected and Redux wasn't used due to the nature of the application.
3. **Backend Services**: Explanation of the decision to keep everything in one file (`server.js`).
4. **Data Handling**: The use of `data.json` as the database instead of MongoDB.
5. **Working Video**: A placeholder for the video demonstration link.
